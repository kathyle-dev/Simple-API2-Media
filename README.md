# Simple API: STOCK MEDIA GENERATOR
#### Project Scope: The user enters an item they would like a stock image or video of. Then they will make a selection via the "photo" or "video" buttons to generate their stock item. If they want to browse through more items of the same keyword, they can press the "more" button which displays after the first response. This is done by fetching the JSON response from the Pixabay API.

# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON

# Optimizations:
#### Press the button and it will randomly give you a stock image or video!

# Lesson Learned:
#### I wanted to display only one image or video at a time but also wanted to allow the user to see more images or photos related to their search. So, I tied the button to a counter that would go display the corresponding array from the JSON response.
